        Netflix is an industry leader in handling large amounts of
        data to predict users needs but also help fine tune their
        internal processes.  This paper will cover how they operate as
        a company and how their use of data visualization has led to
        their success and how they continue to grow and provide
        service to millions with little service interruptions.

        In Southern California, wildfires never seem too out of place
        and seem to be a commonly accepted as a norm for the most
        part.  Over the years this problem has only continued to get
        worse. These fires started to cause massive amounts of
        property damage, loss of life, and hazardous conditions for
        everyone.  When wildfires break out they soon become
        unpredictable due to wind conditions and vegetation.  To
        amplify problems further, most places where burns take place
        are hard to reach by the emergency crews fighting them.  The
        combination of these factors results in scattered resources,
        playing catch up rather than preventing the spread and
        evacuating large areas.  Using Predictive analytics to not
        only know where a fire is going but, possibly preventing it in
        the first place may help save lives and billions of dollars.
